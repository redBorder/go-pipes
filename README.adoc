between different protocols.

The application also support decoding, encoding and processing data, for example
it can decode a JSON and performs modifications on it before send it encoded as

This application uses a backend to route received data. Support multiple workers
on each stage (decoding, encoding, processing and sending). It also has a built
in reporting system, so you can know if the messages has been delivered.
